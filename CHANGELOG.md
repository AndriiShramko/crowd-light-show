## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-28

Studio Slice 1 — live parametric presets + an instant, guest-controlled landing demo.
Layered on top of the existing show engine (same clock sync + safety governor); the
timeline show is unchanged.

### Added

- **Live parametric presets** — instead of streaming frames, the server broadcasts a
  tiny descriptor `{ type, params, epoch, startedAt }` and every phone computes its own
  colour each frame off the synced clock: `rgb = preset(position, params, index, N)`.
  Switching is one small message (epoch++ → instant flip, all phones in sync); a single
  parameter tweak morphs **without** restarting (phase preserved).
- **Four hero presets** — **Pulse** (global breathing), **Color Waves** and
  **Rainbow Chase** (spatial — they split across the crowd by each phone's place),
  and **Ocean** (calm). Operator console gets a live preset panel with parameter sliders.
- **Sticky crowd index** — each phone is handed a stable `index` (0…N-1) on join,
  reused on leave, so spatial presets place it in the room.
- **Server-authoritative preset safety** — `validatePreset()` clamps every parameter to
  a safe range and **simulates** the result; an out-of-envelope preset (strobe, saturated
  red) is structurally unrepresentable. A client-side slew backstop mirrors it.
- **"Try it live" studio demo** (`/studio`) — a guest mints a private, ephemeral room,
  points their own phones at a QR, and switches presets live with **no login**. Switches
  reach only that room (a guest can never touch the real show). Degrades gracefully to a
  single device with a synced on-page crowd preview.
- **Studio kill-switch** — `STUDIO_ENABLED=0` puts the whole new path dormant on prod.
- New tests: `presets_parity` (browser↔server engine identical), `presets_safety`
  (preset governor), and a live `presets_harness` (switch convergence, spatial index
  proof, param morph, safety, guest demo, consent-scroll).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-28

Initial MVP release.

### Added

- **Synchronized crowd phone light show** — the whole crowd's phones flash
  together in time with the music, using the phone **screen** as the light
  source on every device (iOS + Android) plus an optional **Android LED torch**
  mode (with camera permission).
- **Clock sync + pre-baked timeline** — an NTP-like clock-offset handshake over
  WebSocket gives every phone a shared show clock, and the full light timeline
  (cue list) is delivered once on join and runs **locally** on each phone, so
  the crowd stays together on congested networks and keeps running if a phone's
  connection drops.
- **Operator console** with playlist upload, server-side audio analysis,
  QR-code generation for the join link, a master transport
  (**ARM / GO / PAUSE / STOP / BLACKOUT**), and a **nudge** slider to align the
  lights with the live PA sound.
- **Audience experience** — a photosensitivity **consent gate**, synchronized
  **screen flashing**, a **wake lock** to keep the screen on during the show,
  and an always-available **opt-out / Stop**.
- **Server-side safety governor** — a cue compiler that hard-caps flashing to
  **≤ 3 flashes/second**, blocks large **saturated-red strobing**, and **ramps**
  large brightness changes (per WCAG 2.3.1 / 2.3.2 for photosensitive epilepsy).
- **Automated safety tests** and a **multi-client sync harness** to verify the
  flash-rate / strobe limits and the clock-sync + timeline alignment.
- **Dockerized deploy** — runs in a single container (Node.js + ffmpeg).
